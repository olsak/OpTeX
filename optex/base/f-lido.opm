This font family Lido by Storm Type Foundry was designed for Lidove noviny
newspaper. It is similar to Times but it is not Times.

The Lido font family supports 6 standard selectors

\rm Regular          \it Italics
\mf Medium-Regular   \mi Medium-Italics
\bf Bold-Regular     \bi Bold-Italics

and three Condensed variants:

\cond \rm Condensed
      \mf Condensed-Medium
      \bf Condensed-Bold

The italic variants are missing when \cond is selected. This means that
\cond\it does the same as \cond\rm etc.

   \_doc ----------------------------
   \`\dest``[<type>:<spec>]` creates a destination of internal links. The
   destination is declared in the format `<type>:<spec>`. If the \^`\hyperlinks`
   command in not used, then `\dest` does nothing else it is set to `\_destactive`.
   The \`\_destactive` is implemented by `\_pdfdest` primitive. It creates a box
   in which the destination is shifted by \`\_destheight`. The reason is that
   the destination is exactly at the top border of the PDF viewer but we want to see
   the line where the destination is. The destination box is positioned by a
   different way dependent on the current vertical or horizontal mode.

   \_doc ----------------------------
   Each hyperlink is created internally by \`\_xlink``{<type>}{<spec>}{<color>}{<text>}`.
   This macro expands to `\_quitvmode{<text>}` by default, i.e.\ no active
   hyperlink is created, only <text> is printed in horizontal mode (and in a group).
   If \^`\hyperlinks` is used, then `\_xlink` gets the meaning of
   \`\_xlinkactive` and hyperlinks are created by the `\pdfstartlink`/%
   `\pdfendlink` primitives. The <text> has given <color> only when
   hyperlink is created. If `\_<type>linkcolor` is defined, it has
   precedence over <color>.
   \nl
   The \`\_linkdimens` macro declares the dimensions of link area.
   \nl
   A specific action can be defined for each link <type> by the macro
   `\_<type>action{<spec>}`. \OpTeX/ defines only \`\_urlaction``{<url>}`.
   The default link action (when `\_<type>action` is not defined) is
   `goto name{<type>:<spec>}` (an internal link). It is declared in the
   \`\_linkactions``{<type>}{<spec>}` macro.
   \nl
   The `\_pdfstartlink` primitive uses `attr{\_pdfborder{<type>}}`. The
   \`\_pdfborder``{<type>}` macro expands to `/C[? ? ?] /Border[0 0 .6]` if the
   `\_<type>border` macro (i.e.\ \`\_refborder`, \`\_citeborder`, \`\_tocborder`,
   \`\_pgborder`, \`\_urlborder`, \`\_fntborder` or \`\_fnfborder`)
   is defined.

   \_doc ------------------------------
   \`\link``[<type>:<spec>]{<color>}{<text>}` creates a link. It is
   kept here for backward compatibility and it is
   equivalent to \^`\_xlink{<type>}{<spec>}{<color>}{<text>}`.
   If `\_<type>action` is not defined then
   `\link` creates internal link do the \^`\dest[<type>:<spec>]`.
   You can have more links with the same `<type>:<spec>` but only one \^`\dest`
   in the document.
   \nl
   \`\ilink``[<type>:<spec>]{<text>}` is equivalent to \^`\link` but
   the `<color>` is used from \^`\hyperlinks` declaration
   (or it is overwriten by `\def\_<type>linkcolor`).
   \nl
   \`\ulink``[<url>]{<text>}` creates external link.
   The `<url>` is detokenized with `\escapechar=-1` before it is used, so
   `\%`, `\#` etc. can be used in the `<url>`.
   \_cod ----------------------------

\_def\_link[#1:#2]{\_xlink{#1}{#2}}
\_def\_ilink[#1:#2]#3{\_xlink{#1}{#2}\_ilinkcolor{#3}}

   \_doc ----------------------------
   \`\hyperlinks``<ilink color><ulink color>` activates `\dest`, `\xlink`,
   so that they create links. Not setting colors (`\hyperlinks{}{}`) is also
   supported.
   \_cod ----------------------------

\_def\_hyperlinks#1#2{%
   \_let\_dest=\_destactive \_let\_xlink=\_xlinkactive

   \_doc ----------------------------
   \`\url``{<url>}` does approximately the same as \^`\ulink``[<url>]{<url>}`, but
   more work is done before the `\ulink` is processed. The link-version of <url>
   is saved to `\_tmpa` and the printed version in `\_tmpb`. The printed
   version is processed in four steps: 1.~the `\|` are replaced by `[||]` (we
   suppose that such string does not exist in any URL). 2.~it is detokenized with
   `\escapechar=-1`. 3.~muti-strings and spaces are replaced by strings in
   braces `{...}`. 4.~internal penalties and skips are put between characters
   using \`\_urlA`, \`\_urlB` and \`\_urlC`. The step~4 do following:
   The \`\_urlxskip` is inserted between each pair of \"normal characters",
   i.e.\ characters not declared by `\sdef{_ur:<character>}`.
   The special characters declared by `\sdef{_ur:<character>}` are replaced
   by the body of their corresponding macro.
   The \`\_urlskip`, \`\_urlbskip`, \`\_urlgskip`
   are typical skips used for special characters, their meaning is
   documented in the code below. You can change them.
   Default values: penalty 9990 is inserted between each pair of normal
   chararacters, penalty 100 is inserted after special charcters, nobreak before special
   characters. The URL can be broken at any place using these default
   values. If you want to disable breaking between normal characters, say
   `\let\_urlxskip=\nobreak`.
   \nl
   The text version of the `<url>` is printed in \`\_urlfont`.

There are six types of internal links and one type of external link used
in \OpTeX/. They are used in the format <type>:<spec>.

\begitems
* `ref:<label>`     -- the destination is created when `\label[<label>]` is used,
                       see also the section \ref[references].
* `toc:<tocrefnum>` -- the destination is created at chap/sec/secc titles,
                       see also the section \ref[maketoc].
* `pg:<gpageno>`    -- the destination is created at beginning of each page,
                       see also the section \ref[output].
* `cite:<bibpart>/<bibnum>`   -- the destination is created in bibliography reference,
                       see section \ref[bib].
* `fnt:<gfnotenum>` -- link form text to footnote, see also section~\ref[fnotes].
* `fnf:<gfnotenum>` -- link from footnote to text, see also section~\ref[fnotes].
* `url:<url>`       -- used by `\url` or `\ulink`,
                       see also the end of this section.
\enditems

The `<tocrefnum>`, `<gpageno>`, `<bibnum>`, and `<gfnotenum>` are numbers starting
from one and globally incremented by one in the whole document. The registers \^`\tocrefnum`,
\^`\gpageno`, \^`\bibnum`, and \^`\_gfnotenum` are used for these numbers.

When a chap/sec/secc title is prefixed by `\label[<label>]`, then both types
of internal links are created at the same destination place:
`toc:<tocrefnum>` and `ref:<label>`.

The color for active links can be declared by `\def\_<type>linkcolor`, the
border around link can be declared by `\def\_<type>border`. These macros are
not declared by default, so color for active links are given only by
\^`\hyperlinks` macro and borders are invisible.
For example `\def\_toclinkcolor{\Red}` means that links from table of
contents are in red.
Another example `\def\_tocborder{1 0 0}` causes red frames in TOC
(not printed, only visible in PDF viewers).

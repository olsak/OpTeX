\_codedecl \tikzpicture {TikZ for OpTeX <2021-07-15>}

   \_doc
   This package is OpTeX's compatibility layer for PGF/TikZ. When users do
   `\load[tikz]` they expect `tikz.tex` to be loaded, but this file gets loaded
   instead. It does load `tikz.tex`, but also does fixups.

   First we load TikZ itself.

   \_cod

\_load[tikz.tex]

   PGF's `\pgfutil@everybye` hooks into `\end`, but normally \OpTeX/ uses the
   prefixed `\_end`. Here we make it hook into `\_byehook` which should
   hopefully be preserved by all \OpTeX/ macro writers.
   \_cod

\_addto\_byehook{\_the\_cs{pgfutil@everybye}}

   \_doc
   There is a general disagreement about the use/meaning of `\hoffset` and
   `\voffset` -- \LaTeX/, the \LaTeX/ `crop`
   package\fnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/crop}}, TikZ, and \OpTeX/ all
   try to use the values differently. Unfortunately this means a broken
   behaviour observed by end users in
   \OpTeX/\fnote{\url{https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf/issues/983}}.

   The problem at hand is that PGF nowadays sets the page origin to include
   `\hoffset` and `\voffset`. We instead set it to the origin (i.e. the point
   $(0, 0)$).
   \_cod

\_sdef{pgf@sys@pdf@mark@pos@pgfpageorigin}{\pgfpointorigin}
